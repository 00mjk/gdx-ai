An artificial intelligence framework, entirely written in Java, for game development with [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

The gdxAI project is a libGDX extension living under the [libGDX umbrella](https://github.com/libgdx). However it does not force you to use that specific framework if you do not wish to do so. The libGDX jar remains an essential requirement, though.

GdxAI tries to be a high-performance framework providing some of the most common AI techniques used by game industry.
However, in the present state of the art, the gdxAI framework covers far less than 10% of the entire game AI area, which is really huge. We've tried to focus on what matters most in game AI development, though. And more stuff will come soon.
